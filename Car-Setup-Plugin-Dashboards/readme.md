These plugins require Toms-Car-Setup-Plugin files to be installed in order for them to work.
Cars supported: SK Modified, Tour Modified, NextGen and Trucks.  

IMPORTANT:  These dashboards will require you to enter the garage for them to get initial data for them to work.  
It is easy to enter a track and the game preloads your setup and so you just hit the green practice button without entering the garage.
You will see some of the dashboards show the "NaN" in the data fields.  That is when you know you did not enter the garage first.

Garage Weights Dashboard:  
NOTE: This data is accurate.

The data in the Garage Weights dashboard is static data.
This dashboard does the basic calculations from the garage weights and ride heights data such as:
  Cross weight
  Front %
  Rear %
  Wheel %
  Front to Rear Center line Rake.

Note: The On Track Heights and On Track Weights are lacking accuracy when running fast laps. These are work in progress but you might find them useful.

On Track Heights Dashboard: 
Each wheel has three pieces of data:
  Actual
  Min - Minimum
  Max - Maximum
 The objective was to capture the high and low heights
 
 Rake - Actual, Minimum, Maximum.  This is the center line rake front to back.

On Track Weights:

We can't get actual weights but we can get the weight distribution by the ride heights.  Now we are still challenged with accuracy at full speed, but they are still close enough for the dynamic distribution numbers to be useful.  Especially the Cross Weight range through a corner.
