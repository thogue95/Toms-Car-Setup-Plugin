Car Setup Plugin Source Files

The objective of this plugin is to provide data that is useful when building a car setup to the driver when in the car.  
Useful data comes in two forms, Static and Dynamic.  Easier terms are On-track and Garage data.  Both are interchangeable terms.

The source code is hopefully easy to read.  I use the shock travel as a measuring tool to determine dynamic ride heights.  The results of those calculations are
pretty accurate when on pit road or when doing a slow lap.  Accuracy is lost when traveling a full speed.

You will see commented out lines of code where I used property values to do some debug.

Also you will see that only SK Modifieds, Tour Modifieds, NextGen and Trucks are supported.  Those are pretty much the cars I have been driving lately.

Static data all appears to be accurate.

This is an EARLY work in progress so let me know if you find any errors and have any fixes.


Have fun.
